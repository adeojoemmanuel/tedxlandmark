                TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth
                Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California
                25 years ago, TED has grown to support those worldchanging ideas with multiple initiatives. The annual
                TED
                Conference invites the world's leading thinkers and doers
                to speak for 18 minutes. Their talks are then made
                available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included
                Bill Gates, Al Gore, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir
                Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani,Philippe Starck,
                Ngozi Okonjo- Iweala, Isabel Allende and UK Prime
                Minister Gordon Brown. The annual TED Conference
                takes place in Long Beach, California, with simulcast in
                Palm Springs; TEDGlobal is held each year in Oxford,
                UK. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where
                new TEDTalks are posted daily, and the Open
                Translation Project, which provides subtitles and
                interactive transcripts as well as the ability for any
                TEDTalk to be translated by volunteers worldwide. TED
                has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional
                individuals with a wish to change the world are given the
                opportunity to put their wishes into action; TEDx, which
                offers individuals or groups a way to host local, selforganised events around the world, and the
                TEDFellows
                program, helping world-changing innovators from around
                the globe to become part of the TED community and,
                with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable
                projects and activities.

                        In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program
                        of local, self-organised events that bring people together
                        to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event,
                        TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark
                        deep discussion and connection in a small group. These
                        local, self-organised events are branded TEDx, where x
                        = independently organised TED event. The TED
                        Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx
                        program, but individual TEDx events are self-organised.

                        TEDxLandmarkU is a student initiative for those who are willing to inspire people and bring
                        a change in the community. Our vision is to instigate the thought process and allow the
                        person to fathom the depths of comprehension of the human mind. Our aim is to exhibit new
                        and redefined ways of doing tasks with hopes to 'Rebuild' your brain and spark the idea
                        of creativity. With this initiative, we take great pride in bringing a TED-like experience
                        to Landmark University.
